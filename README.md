Some vendors require account registration or minimum purchase commitments for future orders. Completely free samples with no costs are rare and should be approached with caution.

### How much kratom is typically included in sample packages?

Sample quantities usually range from 10-25 grams per strain, with most vendors providing 3-5 different strain varieties per sample package. This amount allows for multiple evaluations while keeping vendor costs manageable. Premium vendors may offer larger sample sizes or more strain options.
